#CWOP-Particle: Citizen Weather Observer Program Reporting Library for Particle devices

This library was created to facilitate in sending weather data in the correct APRS packet format to CWOP. 

This is meant to be a supplement to your own weather-gathering firware, and makes no attempt to actually gather any data - you must provide it!

Please note that in order to send data and have it be used by CWOP, you must register for an ID here: [CWOP Sign-Up][1]

See the [examples][2] directory for a sample of how to use this library, and have fun!
